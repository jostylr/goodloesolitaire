# To do

## 1.5

REQ: Make hail calls have more interesting effect.

REQ: Make toppage index look nice. 

REQ: When a score is added to high scores, highlight it. Class of newHighScore is given for the user's new score; otherNewHighScores is given when others have scored up recently. The classes need to be styled. 


## 2.0

1. Animation for new deck, discard card, draw card
9. Add recent high scores in backend/frontend
11. Detect twitter name or add link (riskier) for high score: give people a way to link back to their identity.
13. Feature: custom link to individual game history
14. Feature: custom link to individual game review (watch)
15. Feature: custom link to individual game replay (play)
14. Feature: Multiple game modes:

	1. Streaking
		This is what we are doing now.
	2. Climb the Mountain
		Goal is to reach highest hand in fewest turns.
	3. Target Practice
		A target hand type is given. Motion towards it is rewarded. Motion away, penalized.
	4. Measured pace
		Points achieved for each hand type in order. 
	5. Staying Alive
		Maintain or improve current hand type, but ranking in it is of no consequence. Points for different hand types are not by ordering, but on perceived difficulty. One downturn is the end game.
	6. Paying the Rent	
		Pot of money. Each card draw costs money. Levels cost money for rent. Level gains give a pot of money. Rent increases as level stays the same. Interest accrues on pot of money each turn with streaks increasing interest. Level loss loses money.
	10. Maybe different scoring rules too. Such as Current Major Level as base and the streak at that level as power.
