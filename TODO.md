# To do

1. Animation for new deck, discard card, draw card
2. Make Start Game / End Game buttons toggleable
5. Animate color/size of score on draw
6. Make About window scrollable for iPhone - test?
8. Scoring: transparent, fun algorithm
9. Add recent high score in back/front 

Scoring pulse does not respond when class removed/added is the same. So it only pulses when it changes direction. Acceptable?
