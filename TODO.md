# To do

BUG: White artifacts under handtext in webkit.

## 2.0
0. When deck is less than 5, constrain card selection to less than 5.
1. Animation for new deck, discard card, draw card
2. Make hail calls have more interesting effect.
9. Add recent high scores in backend/frontend
10. Add personal high scores
11. Give people a way to link back to their identity. Detect twitter name, add link (riskier) for high score, or login thru Facebook.
13. Feature: custom link to individual game history
14. Feature: custom link to individual game review (watch)
15. Feature: custom link to individual game replay (play)
5. Use toppage to [preload](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1059793/pre-loading-external-files-css-javascript-for-other-pages) CSS, JS, PNG
4. Add social media buttons (Facebook links, Facebook share, Tweet, +1)
5. Add share with Facebook button when a person achieves a high score.
5. Add ads
16. [Minify CSS and JS for production](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/compressor/)
17. iOS app


##2.5
14. Feature: Multiple game modes:

	1. Streaking
		This is what we are doing now.
	2. Climb the Mountain
		Goal is to reach highest hand in fewest turns.
	3. Target Practice
		A target hand type is given. Motion towards it is rewarded. Motion away, penalized.
	4. Measured pace
		Points achieved for each hand type in order. 
	5. Staying Alive
		Maintain or improve current hand type, but ranking in it is of no consequence. Points for different hand types are not by ordering, but on perceived difficulty. One downturn is the end game.
	6. Paying the Rent	
		Pot of money. Each card draw costs money. Levels cost money for rent. Level gains give a pot of money. Rent increases as level stays the same. Interest accrues on pot of money each turn with streaks increasing interest. Level loss loses money.
	10. Maybe different scoring rules too. Such as Current Major Level as base and the streak at that level as power.
