1. Animation for new deck, discard card, draw card
2. Make Start Game / End Game buttons toggleable
8. Scoring: transparent, fun algorithm
9. Add recent high score in backend/frontend
10. Apply .scoreplus and .scoreminus to #delta too
11. History table: can use html codes for suits instead of lowercase: &spades; &clubs; &diams; &hearts;
