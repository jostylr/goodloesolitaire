## Origins

Mr. Goodloe had the great misfortune to find himself on a trip filled with the most honest-speaking people on Earth. He thought to himself:"This will not do!"and promptly tried to teach them poker. But, being honest, they had no money to their names.

Pondering this, he went to the top of a mountain for 30 days and 30 nights. When he came down, he had the perfect game: Goodloe Poker. Pass the hand, try to improve it, and make calls whether true or not.

Such is the commonly known history. But what is not so commonly known is that these honest folk had a hard time learning the poker hands and their relative strengths. To remedy this, Mr. Goodloe went deep into the caves for 10 days and 10 nights. When he came out, he taught these honest folk Goodloe Solitaire: just improve the hand.

And so it was that he taught these honest, happy people how to play with themselves and lie to others. All hail the Goodloe!
